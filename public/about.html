<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Tenzin Choden Thinley, a dedicated and detail-oriented individual with a strong foundation in computer science and web design. I hail from the beautiful country of Bhutan, where I'm deeply motivated by the transformative changes being led by our government and King. My passion for technology and global networks drives my ambition to contribute meaningfully to these changes.</p>

<p>I have a solid background in various programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and I honed my skills during my freshman year at Colby College, where I took a Data Structures and Algorithms class. Additionally, I have experience in 3D modeling for 3D printers and laser cutting, showcasing my versatility and technical proficiency. </p>
  
<p>Currently, I work virtually as a web designer for the NGO SHARE, focusing on enhancing their online presence and making their website more findable and inviting to users. My role involves leveraging my skills in website design to support SHARE's diverse programs, particularly in health, which I find especially intriguing. </p>
  
<p>Beyond my professional work, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity and am eager to gain hands-on experience in this field. I believe that understanding technology and its security aspects is crucial for the ongoing development and safety of digital infrastructures in Bhutan. </p>
  
<p>While I excel at listening and taking in others' ideas, I am working on sharing my own insights more openly. My attention to detail allows me to catch things others might miss, although I strive to balance this with keeping sight of the bigger picture. </p>
  
<p>Through continuous learning and practical application of my skills, I aim to support and advocate for technological advancements that align with the progressive vision for Bhutan.</p>
